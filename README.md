# Phishing
Identifying **fake or malicious emails** is an important cybersecurity skill. Attackers use techniques like phishing, spoofing, and malware-laden attachments to trick users. Here's a practical guide to help you spot them:

---

### 🔍 **1. Check the Sender's Email Address**

* **Look closely** at the domain: `support@paypa1.com` vs `support@paypal.com` (notice the number 1 instead of "l").
* Attackers often use slight misspellings or free email services (`@gmail.com`, `@yahoo.com`) instead of official domains.

---

### ⚠️ **2. Look for Urgency or Threats**

* Phrases like:

  * “**Your account will be suspended**”
  * “**Act now** or lose access”
  * “You’ve won a prize—**click to claim**!”
* These are tactics to make you act without thinking.

---

### 🔗 **3. Hover Over Links Before Clicking**

* On desktop: hover your mouse over links to preview the real destination in the status bar.
* A fake email may say `www.amazon.com`, but the actual link might be:

  * `http://malicious-site.ru/login/amazon`

---

### 📎 **4. Be Wary of Attachments**

* Especially if:

  * It’s from an unknown sender
  * It ends in `.exe`, `.zip`, `.scr`, `.js`, or even `.docm`
* These may contain malware or ransomware.

---

### 📄 **5. Check for Poor Grammar or Spelling**

* Many fake emails are written in poor English or have awkward phrasing.
* Example: “Dear customer, You account has suspended for verifcation.”

---

### 🧩 **6. Fake Logos or Layout**

* If the branding looks slightly off, blurry, or low-quality, be suspicious.
* Real companies use professional formatting and spelling.

---

### 🛑 **7. Requests for Personal Information**

* No real company will ask you to:

  * Provide passwords
  * Send OTPs
  * Share your card or bank details via email

---

### 🔐 **8. Look for Missing Security Features**

Legitimate emails from big companies usually have:

* **DKIM/SPF/DMARC protection** (tech details visible in email headers)
* **A verified domain** and **legit support contact info**

---

### 🛠️ **9. Use Email Security Tools**

* **Google Safe Browsing**, **VirusTotal**, or **CheckPhish.ai** can help verify links.
* Browser plugins like **Netcraft**, **McAfee WebAdvisor**, or **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen** offer alerts.

---

### ✅ **10. When in Doubt, Don't Click!**

* **Go directly** to the official website.
* **Contact customer support** using known contact methods—not the ones in the suspicious email.
